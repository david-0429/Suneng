There was no choice next morning but to turn in my 
private reminiscence of Belleville. Two days passed before 
Mr. Fleagle returned the graded papers, and he returned 
everyone’s but mine. I was anxiously expecting for a 
command to report to Mr. Fleagle immediately after school 
for discipline when I saw him lift my paper from his desk 
and rap for the class’s attention. “Now, boys,” he said, “I 
want to read you an essay. This is titled ‘The Art of Eating 
Spaghetti.’” And he started to read. My words! He was 
reading my words out loud to the entire class. What’s more, 
the entire class was listening attentively. Then somebody 
laughed, then the entire class was laughing, and not in 
contempt and ridicule, but with openhearted enjoyment. I did 
my best to avoid showing pleasure, but what I was feeling 
was pure ecstasy at this startling demonstration that my 
words had the power to make people laugh.

We usually take time out only when we really need to 
switch off, and when this happens we are often overtired, 
sick, and in need of recuperation. Me time is complicated by 
negative associations with escapism, guilt, and regret as well 
as overwhelm, stress, and fatigue. All these negative 
connotations mean we tend to steer clear of it. Well, I am 
about to change your perception of the importance of me 
time, to persuade you that you should view it as vital for 
your health and wellbeing. Take this as permission to set 
aside some time for yourself! Our need for time in which to 
do what we choose is increasingly urgent in an overconnected, 
overwhelmed, and overstimulated world.

Most parents think that if our child would just “behave,” we 
could stay calm as parents. The truth is that managing our 
own emotions and actions is what allows us to feel peaceful 
as parents. Ultimately we can’t control our children or the 
obstacles they will face ― but we can always control our own 
actions. Parenting isn’t about what our child does, but about 
how we respond. In fact, most of what we call parenting 
doesn’t take place between a parent and child but within the 
parent. When a storm brews, a parent’s response will either 
calm it or trigger a full‐scale tsunami. Staying calm enough to 
respond constructively to all that childish behavior ― and the 
stormy emotions behind it ― requires that we grow, too. If 
we can use those times when our buttons get pushed to 
reflect, not just react, we can notice when we lose 
equilibrium and steer ourselves back on track. This inner 
growth is the hardest work there is, but it’s what enables 
you to become a more peaceful parent, one day at a time.

We have already seen that learning is much more efficient 
when done at regular intervals: rather than cramming an 
entire lesson into one day, we are better off spreading out 
the learning. The reason is simple: every night, our brain 
consolidates what it has learned during the day. This is one 
of the most important neuroscience discoveries of the last 
thirty years: sleep is not just a period of inactivity or a 
garbage collection of the waste products that the brain 
accumulated while we were awake. Quite the contrary: while 
we sleep, our brain remains active; it runs a specific 
algorithm that replays the important events it recorded 
during the previous day and gradually transfers them into a 
more efficient compartment of our memory.


From the earliest times, healthcare services have been 
recognized to have two equal aspects, namely clinical care 
and public healthcare. In classical Greek mythology, the god 
of medicine, Asklepios, had two daughters, Hygiea and 
Panacea. The former was the goddess of preventive health 
and wellness, or hygiene, and the latter the goddess of 
treatment and curing. In modern times, the societal 
ascendancy of medical professionalism has caused treatment 
of sick patients to overshadow those preventive healthcare 
services provided by the less heroic figures of sanitary 
engineers, biologists, and governmental public health officers. 
Nevertheless, the quality of health that human populations 
enjoy is attributable less to surgical dexterity, innovative 
pharmaceutical products, and bioengineered devices than to 
the availability of public sanitation, sewage management, and 
services which control the pollution of the air, drinking 
water, urban noise, and food for human consumption. The 
human right to the highest attainable standard of health 
depends on public healthcare services no less than on the 
skills and equipment of doctors and hospitals.

The above graph shows the distribution of oil demand by 
sector in the OECD in 2020. ① The Road transportation 
sector, which took up 48.6%, was the greatest oil 
demanding sector in the OECD member states. ② The 
percentage of oil demand in the Petrochemicals sector was 
one‐third that of the Road transportation sector. ③ The 
difference in oil demand between the Other industry sector 
and the Petrochemicals sector was smaller than the 
difference in oil demand between the Aviation sector and 
the Electricity generation sector. ④ The oil demand in the 
Residential, commercial and agricultural sector took up 9.8% 
of all oil demand in the OECD, which was the fourth largest 
among all the sectors. ⑤ The percentage of oil demand in 
the Marine bunkers sector was twice that of the oil demand 
in the Rail & domestic waterways sector.

Carl‐Gustaf Rossby was one of a group of notable 
Scandinavian researchers who worked with the Norwegian 
meteorologist Vilhelm Bjerknes at the University of Bergen. 
While growing up in Stockholm, Rossby received a traditional 
education. He earned a degree in mathematical physics at the 
University of Stockholm in 1918, but after hearing a lecture 
by Bjerknes, and apparently bored with Stockholm, he moved 
to the newly established Geophysical Institute in Bergen. In 
1925, Rossby received a scholarship from the Sweden‐America 
Foundation to go to the United States, where he joined the 
United States Weather Bureau. Based in part on his practical 
experience in weather forecasting, Rossby had become a 
supporter of the “polar front theory,” which explains the 
cyclonic circulation that develops at the boundary between 
warm and cold air masses. In 1947, Rossby accepted the chair 
of the Institute of Meteorology, which had been set up for 
him at the University of Stockholm, where he remained until 
his death ten years later.

By noticing the relation between their own actions and 
resultant external changes, infants develop self‐efficacy, a 
sense ① that they are agents of the perceived changes. 
Although infants can notice the effect of their behavior on 
the physical environment, it is in early social interactions 
that infants most ② readily perceive the consequence of 
their actions. People have perceptual characteristics that 
virtually ③ assure that infants will orient toward them. They 
have visually contrasting and moving faces. They produce 
sound, provide touch, and have interesting smells. In 
addition, people engage with infants by exaggerating their 
facial expressions and inflecting their voices in ways that 
infants find ④ fascinating. But most importantly, these antics 
are responsive to infants’ vocalizations, facial expressions, 
and gestures; people vary the pace and level of their 
behavior in response to infant actions. Consequentially, early 
social interactions provide a context ⑤ where infants can 
easily notice the effect of their behavior.

Adam Smith pointed out that specialization, where each of 
us focuses on one specific skill, leads to a general 
improvement of everybody’s well‐being. The idea is simple 
and powerful. By specializing in just one activity ― such as 
food raising, clothing production, or home construction ―
each worker gains ① mastery over the particular activity. 
Specialization makes sense, however, only if the specialist 
can subsequently ② trade his or her output with the output 
of specialists in other lines of activity. It would make no 
sense to produce more food than a household needs unless 
there is a market outlet to exchange that ③ excess food for 
clothing, shelter, and so forth. At the same time, without the 
ability to buy food on the market, it would not be possible 
to be a specialist home builder or clothing maker, since it 
would be ④ necessary to farm for one’s own survival. Thus 
Smith realized that the division of labor is ⑤ limited by the 
extent of the market, whereas the extent of the market is 
determined by the degree of specialization.

It is not the peasant’s goal to produce the highest 
possible time‐averaged crop yield, averaged over many 
years. If your time‐averaged yield is marvelously high as a 
result of the combination of nine great years and one year 
of crop failure, you will still starve to death in that one 
year of crop failure before you can look back to 
congratulate yourself on your great time‐averaged yield. 
Instead, the peasant’s aim is to make sure to produce a 
yield above the starvation level in every single year, even 
though the time‐averaged yield may not be highest. That’s 
why field scattering may make sense. If you have just 
one big field, no matter how good it is on the average, you 
will starve when the inevitable occasional year arrives in 
which your one field has a low yield. But if you have many 
different fields, varying independently of each other, then in 
any given year some of your fields will produce well even 
when your other fields are producing poorly.

There are several reasons why support may not be 
effective. One possible reason is that receiving help could be 
a blow to self‐esteem. A recent study by Christopher Burke 
and Jessica Goren at Lehigh University examined this 
possibility. According to the threat to self‐esteem model, help 
can be perceived as supportive and loving, or it can be seen 
as threatening if that help is interpreted as implying 
incompetence. According to Burke and Goren, support is 
especially likely to be seen as threatening if it is in an area 
that is self‐relevant or self‐defining — that is, in an area 
where your own success and achievement are especially 
important. Receiving help with a self‐relevant task can 
 make you feel bad about yourself, and this can 
undermine the potential positive effects of the help. For 
example, if your self‐concept rests, in part, on your great 
cooking ability, it may be a blow to your ego when a friend 
helps you prepare a meal for guests because it suggests that 
you’re not the master chef you thought you were.

As well as making sense of events through narratives, 
historians in the ancient world established the tradition of 
history as a(n) source of moral lessons and reflections. The 
history writing of Livy or Tacitus, for instance, was in part 
designed to examine the behavior of heroes and villains, 
meditating on the strengths and weaknesses in the characters 
of emperors and generals, providing exemplars for the 
virtuous to imitate or avoid. This continues to be one of the 
functions of history. French chronicler Jean Froissart said he 
had written his accounts of chivalrous knights fighting in the 
Hundred Years’ War “so that brave men should be inspired 
thereby to follow such examples.” Today, historical studies of 
Lincoln, Churchill, Gandhi, or Martin Luther King, Jr. perform 
the same function.

Psychologist Christopher Bryan finds that when we 
shift our emphasis from behavior to character , people 
evaluate choices differently. His team was able to cut 
cheating in half: instead of “Please don’t cheat,” they changed 
the appeal to “Please don’t be a cheater.” When you’re urged 
not to cheat, you can do it and still see an ethical person in 
the mirror. But when you’re told not to be a cheater, the act 
casts a shadow; immorality is tied to your identity, making 
the behavior much less attractive. Cheating is an isolated 
action that gets evaluated with the logic of consequence: Can 
I get away with it? Being a cheater evokes a sense of self, 
triggering the logic of appropriateness: What kind of person 
am I, and who do I want to be? In light of this evidence, 
Bryan suggests that we should embrace nouns more 
thoughtfully. “Don’t Drink and Drive” could be rephrased as: 
“Don’t Be a Drunk Driver.” The same thinking can be applied 
to originality. When a child draws a picture, instead of calling 
the artwork creative, we can say “You are creative.

Taking a stand is important because you become a beacon 
for those individuals who are your people, your tribe, and 
your audience.  When you raise your viewpoint up like a 
flag, people know where to find you; it becomes a rallying 
point. Displaying your perspective lets prospective (and 
current) customers know that you don’t just sell your 
products or services. The best marketing is never just 
about selling a product or service, but about taking a stand —
showing an audience why they should believe in what you’re 
marketing enough to want it at any cost, simply because they 
agree with what you’re doing.  Products can be changed 
or adjusted if they aren’t functioning, but rallying points align 
with the values and meaning behind what you do.

If DNA were the only thing that mattered, there would 
be no particular reason to build meaningful social 
programs to pour good experiences into children and 
protect them from bad experiences.
But brains require the right kind of environment if they 
are to correctly develop. When the first draft of the 
Human Genome Project came to completion at the turn 
of the millennium, one of the great surprises was that 
humans have only about twenty thousand genes.
This number came as a surprise to biologists: given the 
complexity of the brain and the body, it had been 
assumed that hundreds of thousands of genes would be 
required. 
 So how does the massively complicated brain, with its 
eighty‐six billion neurons, get built from such a small 
recipe book? The answer relies on a clever strategy 
implemented by the genome: build incompletely and let 
world experience refine. 


One benefit of reasons and arguments is that they can 
foster humility. If two people disagree without arguing, 
all they do is yell at each other. No progress is made. 
Both still think that they are right. In contrast, if both 
sides give arguments that articulate reasons for their 
positions, then new possibilities open up. One of the 
arguments gets refuted — that is, it is shown to fail. In 
that case, the person who depended on the refuted 
argument learns that he needs to change his view. 
That is one way to achieve humility — on one side at 
least. Another possibility is that neither argument is 
refuted. Both have a degree of reason on their side. 
Even if neither person involved is convinced by the 
other’s argument, both can still come to appreciate the 
opposing view. 
They also realize that, even if they have some truth, 
they do not have the whole truth. They can gain 
humility when they recognize and appreciate the 
reasons against their own view.

Adaptation involves changes in a population, with 
characteristics that are passed from one generation to the 
next. This is different from acclimation — an individual 
organism’s changes in response to an altered environment. 
 For example, if you spend the summer outside, you 
may acclimate to the sunlight: your skin will increase its 
concentration of dark pigments that protect you from the 
sun.  This is a temporary change, and you won’t pass 
the temporary change on to future generations. However, the capacity to produce skin pigments is 
inherited. For populations living in intensely sunny environments, individuals 
with a good ability to produce skin pigments are more likely 
to thrive, or to survive, than people with a poor ability to 
produce pigments, and that trait becomes increasingly common 
in subsequent generations.  If you look around, you can 
find countless examples of adaptation. The distinctive 
long neck of a giraffe, for example, developed as individuals 
that happened to have longer necks had an advantage in 
feeding on the leaves of tall trees. 

On any day of the year, the tropics and the hemisphere 
that is experiencing its warm season receive much more 
solar radiation than do the polar regions and the colder 
hemisphere. Averaged over the course of the year, 
the tropics and latitudes up to about 40° receive more total 
heat than they lose by radiation. Latitudes above 40° 
receive less total heat than they lose by radiation. This inequality produces the necessary conditions for the 
operation of a huge, global‐scale engine that takes on heat 
in the tropics and gives it off in the polar regions 
Its working fluid is the atmosphere, especially the moisture 
it contains.  Air is heated over the warm earth of the 
tropics, expands, rises, and flows away both northward and 
southward at high altitudes, cooling as it goes. It 
descends and flows toward the equator again from more 
northerly and southerly latitudes.

Greenwashing involves misleading a consumer into 
thinking a good or service is more environmentally friendly 
than it really is. Greenwashing ranges from making 
environmental claims required by law, and therefore 
irrelevant (CFC‐free for example), to puffery (exaggerating 
environmental claims) to fraud. Researchers have shown 
that claims on products are often too vague or misleading. 
Some products are labeled “chemical‐free,” when the fact is 
everything contains chemicals, including plants and animals. 
Products with the highest number of misleading or 
unverifiable claims were laundry detergents, household 
cleaners, and paints. Environmental advocates agree there is 
still a long way to go to ensure shoppers are adequately 
informed about the environmental impact of the products 
they buy. The most common reason for greenwashing is to 
attract environmentally conscious consumers. Many consumers 
do not find out about the false claims until after the 
purchase. Therefore, greenwashing may increase sales in 
the short term. However, this strategy can seriously 
backfire when consumers find out they are being deceived.
While greenwashing might bring a company profits 
 temporarily by deceiving environmentally conscious 
consumers, the company will face serious trouble when 
the consumers figure out they were misinformed.

The driver of FOMO (the fear of missing out) is the 
social pressure to be at the right place with the right 
people, whether it’s from a sense of duty or just trying to 
get ahead, we feel  obligated to attend certain events 
for work, for family and for friends. This pressure from 
society combined with FOMO can wear us down. According 
to a recent survey, 70 percent of employees admit that 
when they take a vacation, they still don’t  disconnect
from work. Our digital habits, which include constantly 
checking emails, and social media timelines, have become 
so firmly established, it is nearly impossible to simply 
enjoy the moment, along with the people with whom we 
are sharing these moments. JOMO (the joy of missing out) is the emotionally 
intelligent antidote to FOMO and is essentially about being 
present and being  content with where you are at in 
life. You do not need to compare your life to others but 
instead, practice tuning out the background noise of the 
“shoulds” and “wants” and learn to let go of worrying 
whether you are doing something wrong. JOMO allows us 
to live life in the slow lane, to appreciate human 
connections, to be  intentional with our time, to 
practice saying “no,” to give ourselves “tech‐free breaks,” 
and to give ourselves permission to acknowledge where 
we are and to feel emotions. Instead of constantly trying 
to keep up with the rest of society, JOMO allows us to be 
who we are in the present moment. When you free up
that competitive and anxious space in your brain, you have 
so much more time, energy, and emotion to conquer your 
true priorities. 

There was a very wealthy man who was bothered by 
severe eye pain. He consulted many doctors and was 
treated by several of them. He did not stop consulting a 
galaxy of medical experts; he was heavily medicated and 
underwent hundreds of injections. However, the pain 
persisted and was worse than before. At last,  he
heard about a monk who was famous for treating patients 
with his condition. Within a few days, the monk was 
called for by the suffering man.
The monk understood the wealthy man’s problem and 
said that for some time he should concentrate only on 
green colours and not let his eyes see any other colours. 
The wealthy man thought it was a strange prescription, 
but he was desperate and decided to try it. He got 
together a group of painters and purchased barrels of 
green paint and ordered that every object he was likely 
to see be painted green just as the monk had suggested.
In a few days everything around  that man was 
green. The wealthy man made sure that nothing around 
him could be any other colour. When the monk came to 
visit him after a few days, the wealthy man’s servants 
ran with buckets of green paint and poured them all over 
him because he was wearing red clothes. He asked 
the servants why they did that.
They replied, “We can’t let our master see any other 
colour.” Hearing this, the monk laughed and said “If only 
you had purchased a pair of green glasses for just a few 
dollars, you could have saved these walls, trees, pots, 
and everything else and you could have saved a large 
share of  his fortune. You cannot paint the whole 
world green.

Dear Mr. Terry Walter, I am the principal of Springfield Public School. As you
know, Springfield Public School is located at the intersection
of First Street and Pine Street. The safety of our children
is at risk largely due to the disregard for speed limits by
motorists traveling along Pine Street. I have regularly
witnessed vehicles traveling far in excess of the speed limit
on Pine Street. Additionally, parents have expressed concern
for the safety of their children who must cross Pine Street.
For these reasons, we are requesting the installation of
speed bumps on Pine Street. I know that one of your
missions, as well as ours, is to ensure that our young
people are afforded a safe and secure environment to and
from school each day. I anticipate that your approval of this
request will greatly improve the safety of our children.
Sincerely, Emma Hudson


When you enter a store, what do you see? It is quite
likely that you will see many options and choices. It doesn’t
matter whether you want to buy tea, coffee, jeans, or a
phone. In all these situations, we are basically flooded with
options from which we can choose. What will happen if we
ask someone, whether online or offline, if he or she prefers
having more alternatives or less? The majority of people
will tell us that they prefer having more alternatives. This
finding is interesting because, as science suggests, the more
options we have, the harder our decision making process will
be. The thing is that when the amount of options exceeds a
certain level, our decision making will start to suffer.

What we need in education is not measurement,
accountability, or standards. While these can be useful tools
for improvement, they should hardly occupy center stage.
Our focus should instead be on making sure we are giving
our youth an education that is going to arm them to save
humanity. We are faced with unprecedented perils, and these
perils are multiplying and pushing at our collective gates.
We should be bolstering curriculum that helps young people
mature into ethical adults who feel a responsibility to the
global community. Without this sense of responsibility we
have seen that many talented individuals give in to their
greed and pride, and this destroys economies, ecosystems,
and entire species. While we certainly should not abandon
efforts to develop standards in different content areas, and
also strengthen the STEM subjects, we need to take
seriously our need for an education centered on global
responsibility. If we don’t, we risk extinction.

Although we don’t know the full neurological effects of
digital technologies on young children’s development, we do
know that all screen time is not created equal. For example,
reading an e­book, videoconferencing with grandma, or
showing your child a picture you just took of them is not
the same as the passive, television­watching screen time
that concerns many parents and educators. So, rather than
focusing on how much children are interacting with screens,
parents and educators are turning their focus instead to
what children are interacting with and who is talking with
them about their experiences. Though parents may be
tempted to hand a child a screen and walk away, guiding
children’s media experiences helps them build important 21st
Century skills, such as critical thinking and media literacy.

Many parents do not understand why their teenagers
occasionally behave in an irrational or dangerous way. At
times, it seems like teens don’t think things through or fully
consider the consequences of their actions. Adolescents
differ from adults in the way they behave, solve problems,
and make decisions. There is a biological explanation for
this difference. Studies have shown that brains continue to
mature and develop throughout adolescence and well into
early adulthood. Scientists have identified a specific region
of the brain that is responsible for immediate reactions
including fear and aggressive behavior. This region develops
early. However, the frontal cortex, the area of the brain that
controls reasoning and helps us think before we act,
develops later. This part of the brain is still changing and
maturing well into adulthood.

The graph above shows the division of labor in households
where both parents work full­time in 2015. ① The
percentage of “mother does more” households in every
category is higher than that of “father does more”
households. ② While the category with the highest
percentage of “mother does more” households is “Managing
children’s schedules / activities,” the category with the
highest percentage of “father does more” households is
“Disciplining children.” ③ When it comes to taking care of
children when they’re sick, the percentage of “mother does
more” households is the same as that of “share equally”
households. ④ The percentage of “share equally” households
is over two times higher than that of “mother does more”
households in three categories. ⑤ The category that shows
the highest percentage of “share equally” households is
“Playing or doing activities with children,” followed by the
category “Disciplining children.

 Shah Rukh Khan is an Indian film actor and producer.
Khan studied economics in college but spent much of his
time at Delhi’s Theatre Action Group, where he studied
acting. He moved from Delhi to Mumbai to pursue a
full­time career in Bollywood, which led him to great fame.
Referred to in the media as the “King of Bollywood” or
“King Khan,” he has appeared in more than 80 Bollywood
films. In 2007, the French government awarded Khan the
Order of Arts and Letters for his contribution to cinema. He
is regularly featured on lists of the most influential people
in Indian culture, and in 2008, he was chosen as one of the
50 most powerful people in the world. Khan’s philanthropic
endeavors have provided health care and disaster relief, and
he was honored with UNESCO’s Pyramide con Marni award
in 2011 for his support of children’s education.

Are cats liquid or solid? That’s the kind of question that
could win a scientist an Ig Nobel Prize, a parody of the
Nobel Prize that honors research that “makes people laugh,
then think.” But it wasn’t with this in mind ① that
Marc­Antoine Fardin, a physicist at Paris Diderot University,
set out to find out whether house cats flow. Fardin noticed
that these furry pets can adapt to the shape of the
container they sit in  similarly to what fluids such as
water do. So he applied rheology, the branch of physics that
deals with the deformation of matter, to calculate the time
 it takes for cats to take up the space of a vase or
bathroom sink. The conclusion? Cats can be either liquid or
solid, depending on the circumstances. A cat in a small box
will behave like a fluid, filling up all the space. But a cat
in a bathtub full of water will try to minimize its contact
with it and  behave very much like a solid.

A phenomenon in social psychology, the Pratfall Effect
states that an individual’s perceived attractiveness increases
or decreases after he or she makes a mistake ― depending
on the individual’s perceived competence. As
celebrities are generally considered to be competent
individuals, and often even presented as flawless or perfect
in certain aspects, committing blunders will make one’s
humanness endearing to others. Basically, those who never
make mistakes are perceived as being less attractive and
“likable” than those who make occasional mistakes.
Perfection, or the attribution of that quality to individuals,
 creates a perceived distance that the general
public cannot relate to ― making those who never make
mistakes perceived as being less attractive or likable.
However, this can also have the opposite effect ― if a
perceived average or less than average competent person
makes a mistake, he or she will be  less
attractive and likable to others.

A lovely little girl was holding two apples with both hands.
Her mom came in and softly asked her little daughter with a
smile, “My sweetie, could you give your mom one of your
two apples?” The girl looked up at  her for some seconds.
Then  she suddenly took a quick bite of one apple, and
then quickly of the other. Although the mom felt the smile
on her face freeze, she tried hard not to reveal  her
disappointment. Then the little girl handed one of her bitten
apples to  her, and said, “Mommy, here you are. This is
the sweeter one.” There,  she realized no matter who you
are, how experienced you are, and how knowledgeable you
think you are, you should always delay judgment.

Online environments vary widely in how easily you can
save whatever happens there, what I call its recordability
and preservability. Even though the design, activities, and
membership of social media might change over time, the
content of what people posted usually remains intact. Email,
video, audio, and text messages can be saved. When perfect
preservation is possible, time has been suspended. Whenever
you want, you can go back to reexamine those events from
the past. In other situations, permanency slips between our
fingers, even challenging our reality testing about whether
something existed at all, as when an email that we seem to
remember receiving mysteriously disappears from our inbox.
The slightest accidental tap of the finger can send an
otherwise everlasting document into nothingness.

Verbal and nonverbal signs are not only relevant but also
significant to intercultural communication. The breakdown of
them helps to identify aspects of conversations. Here is an
excellent example. Newly hired Indian and Pakistani
assistants in a staff cafeteria at Heathrow Airport were often
perceived as rude or uncooperative by their supervisors and
the airport staff, while the Indian and Pakistani women
complained of discrimination. Observation revealed that intonation patterns
 were the primary cause. When the staff
ordered meat, the cafeteria assistant was supposed to ask
them whether they would like to have some gravy. Instead
of saying “gravy?” with a rising intonation, the Asian
assistants would say “gravy” with a falling intonation, which
is their normal way of asking a question. However, this may
appear rude to native speakers of English: “gravy” with
falling intonation came across as a statement, suggesting
“This is gravy. Take it or leave it.”

Science can only tell us how the world appears to us,
not how it is independent of our observation of it, and
therefore right now will always elude science. When you
look into space, you are looking into an ancient past. Some
of the stars are already long dead yet we still see them
because of their traveling light. Let’s say that we are on
one of those stars situated roughly sixty million light­years
away. If we had a really awesome telescope pointed at the
earth, we would see the dinosaurs walking around. The end
of the universe is probably so old that if we had that
telescope, we might be able to see the beginning. Besides
faraway things, even the immediate objects around us are
 because there is still a
time lag for the reflection of light to reach our eyes. Every
sensation our body feels has to wait for the information to
be carried to the brain.

 For many centuries European science, and knowledge in
general, was recorded in Latin ― a language that no one
spoke any longer and that had to be learned in schools.
Very few individuals, probably less than one percent, had
the means to study Latin enough to read books in that
language and therefore to participate in the intellectual
discourse of the times. Moreover, few people had access to
books, which were handwritten, scarce, and expensive. The
great explosion of scientific creativity in Europe was
certainly helped by the sudden spread of information brought
about by Gutenberg’s use of movable type in printing and by
the legitimation of everyday languages, which rapidly
replaced Latin as the medium of discourse. In
sixteenth­century Europe it became much easier to make a
creative contribution not necessarily because more creative
individuals were born then than in previous centuries or
because social supports became more favorable, but because
information became more widely accessible.

Calling your pants “blue jeans” almost seems redundant
because practically all denim is blue. While jeans are
probably the most versatile pants in your wardrobe, blue
actually isn’t a particularly neutral color.
Ever wonder why it’s the most commonly used hue? Blue
was the chosen color for denim because of the chemical
properties of blue dye. Most dyes will permeate fabric in
hot temperatures, making the color stick.
The natural indigo dye used in the first jeans, on the other
hand, would stick only to the outside of the threads. When
the indigo­dyed denim is washed, tiny amounts of that dye
get washed away, and the thread comes with them.
The more denim was washed, the softer it would get,
eventually achieving that worn­in, made­just­for­me
feeling you probably get with your favorite jeans. That
softness made jeans the trousers of choice for laborers.

 Your concepts are a primary tool for your brain to
guess the meaning of incoming sensory inputs.
For example, concepts give meaning to changes in sound
pressure so you hear them as words or music instead
of random noise. In Western culture, most music is
based on an octave divided into twelve equally spaced
pitches: the equal­tempered scale codified by Johann
Sebastian Bach in the 17th century.All people of Western culture with normal hearing have a
concept for this ubiquitous scale, even if they can’t
explicitly describe it. Not all music uses this scale, however.
When Westerners hear Indonesian gamelan music for the
first time, which is based on seven pitches per octave
with varied tunings, it’s more likely to sound like noise.
A brain that’s been wired by listening to twelve­tone
scales doesn’t have a concept for that music.

Framing matters in many domains.  When credit
cards started to become popular forms of payment in the
1970s, some retail merchants wanted to charge different
prices to their cash and credit card customers. To
prevent this, credit card companies adopted rules that
forbade their retailers from charging different prices to cash
and credit customers. However, when a bill was introduced in Congress to
outlaw such rules, the credit card lobby turned its
attention to language. Its preference was that if a
company charged different prices to cash and credit
customers, the credit price should be considered the
“normal” (default) price and the cash price a discount ―
rather than the alternative of making the cash price the
usual price and charging a surcharge to credit card
customers.  The credit card companies had a good
intuitive understanding of what psychologists would come to
call “framing.”  The idea is that choices depend, in
part, on the way in which problems are stated.

Tap your finger on the surface of a wooden table or desk,
and observe the loudness of the sound you hear. Then,
place your ear flat on top of the table or desk.  With
your finger about one foot away from your ear, tap the
table top and observe the loudness of the sound you hear
again. The volume of the sound you hear with your
ear on the desk is much louder than with it off the desk.
Sound waves are capable of traveling through many
solid materials as well as through air.  Solids, like
wood for example, transfer the sound waves much better
than air typically does because the molecules in a solid
substance are much closer and more tightly packed together
than they are in air. This allows the solids to carry the waves more easily
and efficiently, resulting in a louder sound.The density of the air itself
also plays a determining factor in the loudness of sound
waves passing through it. 


At their heart, games differ from other media in one
fundamental way: they offer players the chance to influence
outcomes through their own efforts. With rare exception,
this is not true of film, novels, or television. Readers and
viewers of these other media follow along, reacting to the
story and its twists and turns, without having a direct
personal impact on the events they witness. ③ In the same
manner, video games can have a negative impact on
spending habits if players buy many game­related items and
continually upgrade software and hardware packages. In
games, players have the unique ability to control what
unfolds.  As Sid Meier, a game designer, once said, “A
good game is a series of interesting choices.”


A primary school teacher is helping students to
understand fractional parts by using what she thinks is a
commonplace reference. “Today, we’re going to talk about
cutting up a Thanksgiving holiday favorite ―pumpkin pie.”
She continues with an explanation of parts. Well into her
discourse, a young African American boy, looking puzzled,
asks, “What is pumpkin pie?” Most African Americans are
likely to serve sweet potato pie for holiday dinners. In
fact, one of the ways that African American parents
explain pumpkin pie to their children is to say that it is
something like sweet potato pie. For them, sweet potato
pie is the common referent. Even the slight difference of
being unfamiliar with pumpkin pie can serve as a source
of interference for the student. Rather than be engaged
actively in the lesson, he may have been preoccupied
with trying to imagine pumpkin pie: What does it taste
like? How does it smell? Is its texture chunky like apple
or cherry pie? In the mind of a child, all of these
questions can become more of the focus than the subject
of fractions that the teacher is attempting to teach.

Even small differences in cultural knowledge have
the potential to affect students’ learning .

 In 2000, James Kuklinski of the University of Illinois led
an influential experiment in which more than 1,000 Illinois
residents were asked questions about welfare. More than
half indicated that they were confident that their answers
were correct ― but in fact, only three percent of the people
got more than half of the questions right. Perhaps more
disturbingly, the ones who were the most confident they
were right were generally the ones who knew the least
about the topic. Kuklinski calls this sort of response the “I
know I’m right” syndrome. “It implies not only that most
people will resist correcting their factual beliefs,” he wrote,
“but also that the very people who most need to correct
them will be least likely to do so.”
 How can we have things so wrong and be so sure that
we’re right? Part of the answer lies in the way our brains
are wired. Generally, people tend to seek consistency. There is a substantial body of psychological research
showing that people tend to interpret information with an
eye toward reinforcing their preexisting views. If we
believe something about the world, we are more likely to
passively accept as truth any information that confirms our
beliefs, and actively dismiss information that doesn’t. This
is known as “motivated reasoning.” Whether or not the
consistent information is accurate, we might accept it as
fact, as confirmation of our beliefs. This makes us more
confident in said beliefs, and even less likely to entertain
facts that contradict them.


 Once, there were two woodcutters ― a young, strong one
and an old one ― cutting down trees in a jungle. The young
man was very hardworking. On his first day, (a) he worked
through his break time and complained that the old man
was wasting time, taking several breaks to eat and drink.
That day, the young woodcutter brought 15 trees to their
boss. “Fantastic!” the boss said. “Keep up the great work.
Highly motivated by his words, the young woodcutter
tried harder the next day, but  he could only bring ten
trees. The third day he tried even harder, but he was only
able to bring seven trees. Day after day, he was bringing
less and less trees. As time went by,  he noticed that
even though he worked through his break time and hardly
took a rest, the old woodcutter was cutting down the same
amount of trees as him ― and sometimes chopped down
even more.It was as if the old man worked through the break time
just as  he did. So, the young woodcutter decided to
work harder the next day. Unfortunately, the results were
even worse. “I must be losing my strength,” the young man
thought. One day, the old man invited him for a drink
during the break time. The young man refused and said he
had no extra time. Then, the old man smiled and said to
him, “It is a waste of effort to keep chopping trees without
re­sharpening your axe. Sooner or later, you will have to
give up because you’ve spent too much energy.”
Suddenly the young woodcutter realized that during break
times while the old man was having a drink, he was also
re­sharpening his axe, which the young woodcutter never
did. That’s how  he could chop more than the young man
in less time! The old man said that we all need time to
relax, to think and meditate, and to learn and grow. If we
don’t take the time to sharpen the “axe,” we will become
dull and lose our effectiveness.
